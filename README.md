# YellowBrick
YellowBrick is financially framed SaaS platform designed for investment, agents, brokers, and corporate clientele.
YellowBrick is an MVP and due to the proprietary nature of the code I can only provide code snippets of my code. 
This repository contains SQL, .NET, and React code.
As a software engineer I contributed the files listed within the folders below.  I handled all the coding from the backend to the frontend. 
● Developed and structured the blogs display, management, and create functionalities from front-end to back-end.
● Created the necessary tables, bridgetable, and stored procedures in SQL utilizing joins, foreign keys and pagination.
● Built the API endpoints with .NET using C# and thoroughly tested with Postman.
