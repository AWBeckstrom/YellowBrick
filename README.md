# YellowBrick
YellowBrick is a financially framed SaaS platform designed for investment agents, brokers, and corporate clientele.
These YellowBrick files are part of an MVP. Due to the proprietary nature I can only provide the code snippets you can view here. 
This repository contains code prepared in MS SQL Server, Visual Studio .NET, and VSCode React.
As a software engineer I contributed the files listed within the folders above.  I handled all the coding from the backend to the frontend. 
● Developed and structured the blogs display, management, and create functionalities from front-end to back-end.
● Created the necessary tables, primary keys, foreign keys, bridgetable, and stored procedures in SQL utilizing joins, and pagination.
● Built the API endpoints with .NET using C# and thoroughly tested with Postman.
